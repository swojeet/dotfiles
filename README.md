# Swojeet's Dotfiles

* I maintain this repo for my dotfiles. Right now, I've only added the dotfiles and my configurations for `vim`.
* Feel free to make any suggestions!
* Feel free to contribute additional dotfiles. 


## Vim
* Set up [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim), copy the contents of `vimrc` into `~/.vimrc`, run `:PluginInstall` from vim, copy the `colors` folder into `~/.vim/` and you're good to go!
